Hi Team,

Hoping you all are doing well and enjoying winter. 

I worked on the data mentioned in the link provided by Nada Ibrahim. I worked on Fetch Rewards data (receipts, users, brand) 
and below are my methodology and observations regarding the data. 

Methodology 
For my analysis, I have used R to read the files, modify its nested data structure to a columnar dataframe. Once the structure gets fixed, 
run some sanity checks for quality and had a few observations that like to share with the team.   

Observations

1. Encountered duplicate users in the user table wondering what might be the case. 
2. 186 brand codes that were present in the receipts table were missing the brand table. On checking visually for a few records like 7UP, Advil, etc
are present in both the table but it still comes under the missing brand info list. 
3. No style uniformity in saving 'brandcode' info in the table. Ideally, it should be numeric so that it can join easily with other tables.
4. ID column start with _ that create problem in selecting column hence it index position has been used in the data processing   

Love to discuss these points further over a call and can schedule a time to discuss further on these observations. 

Thanks and Regards
